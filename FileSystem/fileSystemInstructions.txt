Hello Giuseppe,

Please use the example spiffsinternal from the path mentioned earlier. 
The SSI port we are using is SSI-1. Once you import the file update the
 example code files MSP_EXP432E401Y.c, MSP_EXP432E401Y.h and Board.h (attached)

2262.Board.hMSP_EXP432E401Y.cMSP_EXP432E401Y.h

Add the following two files to your project as there is a bug we found 
during the debug with external flash. This is marked to be fixed in the next SDK release.

SPIMSP432E4DMA.cSPIMSP432E4DMA.h

We are using a Macronix Serial Flash part MX66L51235F
